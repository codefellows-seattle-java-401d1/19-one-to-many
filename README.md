# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) One-to-many Relationships 

## Live Heroku 
https://restful-theaters-timtheater01.herokuapp.com/ 

## Resources
* [RESTful Spring Repositories](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-jpa-hibernate-postgresql-restful-crud-api-example/)

You're provided with a server that models movie theater companies and theater
locations. There is a one-to-many relationship between a movie theater company
and the locations they operate. The `Regal` and `AMC` companies have locations
in many different cities (even multiple locations in the same city).

The server has the `MovieCompany` and `TheaterLocation` classes modeled and
annotated to integrate with the Java Persistence API (JPA). Your job is to
write code inside a `POST` route controller that creates a new
`TheaterLocation` and associates it with an existing `MovieCompany` using
a one-to-many relationship.

## Feature Tasks
* Set up a project with the provided starter code.
* Use Postico, another Postgres admin tool, or craft manual SQL to set up
  a database with the required properties.
* Verify that you can use the provided `Create Movie Company` HTML form,
  server, and route to create new `MovieCompany` instances in your database.
* Verify that you can use the provided `Add Theater Location` to hit the
  controller route configured to receive information for a new theater
  location.
* Vertify that you can send and access all the relevant information you'll need
  to use in this route (`company_id`, `theater name`, `theater address`).
* Use the `MovieCompany` and `TheaterLocation` repository interfaces to create
  new `TheaterLocations`, associate them with the proper `MovieCompany` and
  save them.
* Use Heroku command line tools to create a heroku app, deploy your solution
  and push up a database with pre-existing data in it. (remember that you have
  to go to heroku's website and specifically add the `Heroku Postgres` add-on).
  
```
 heroku create restful-theaters-<your_unique_name>
 git push heroku master

 DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432
 heroku pg:push restful-theaters DATABASE_URL
 heroku pg:pull DATABASE_URL restful-theaters
```

## Database Structure
The structure (and example contents) of your database should look like the
following. Notice IDs have negative numbers. I've found this is a good way to
keep initial database content out of the way of Spring JPA auto-generated ids.

**Notice!:** we've all run into errors between initializing our databases with
known data then running into conflicts when Spring and the JPA try to generate
their own ids and seeing errors when ids already exist. One way to avoid this
is to initially seed the database with negative ids because Spring and the JPA
will never try to make negative ids. Cool trick, huh?

## Common Configuration Errors

### ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.bind.JAXBException
Verify your project is configured to run Java 1.8 explicitly. `File > Project
Structure` then set `Project SDK` and `Project language level` dropdowns both
to 1.8.


### APPLICATION FAILED TO START
```
Description:
Failed to configure a DataSource: 'url' attribute is not specified
Reason: Failed to determine a suitable driver class
```

Remember to configure the database in the `application.properties` file.

**src/main/resources/application.properties**
```
## Spring DATASOURCE (DataSourceAutoConfiguration & DataSourceProperties)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/restful-theaters
# spring.datasource.username= rajeevkumarsingh
# spring.datasource.password=

# The SQL dialect makes Hibernate generate better SQL for the chosen database
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Hibernate ddl auto (create, create-drop, validate, update)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
```

### Database does not exist
Watch out because with this one you must scroll far up to see the real error.
You'll see other errors like `No identifier specified for entity: MovieCompany`
appear at the end of the log before you scroll further up and see the root
error:

```
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: database "restful-theaters" does not exist
```

Solve it by making sure Postgres is running and you've created a database
called `restful-theaters` as specified by the `application.properties` file.

### PgConnection.createClob() is not yet implemented.

Make sure to add this line to the `application.properties` config file. Sorry,
I'm being mean and intentionally not including it there by default. If you have
read these instructions, congratulations!

```
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true
```

### Exception SpringEL expression: "company.name" (template: "index")
The template engine is having trouble accessing a property on your model class.
Make sure the properties on your model are `public`.
